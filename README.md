# Weather Dashboard
Enter a city to access the current weather and a five day forecast

## Description

This weather dashboard will display weather data from cities that exist within the OpenWeather API.  Data include weather icons, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index.

One drawback of the dashboard is nonspecificity of the search function.  A potential upgrade for future use is allowing the user to choose between multiple cities of the same name.  For example, choosing between Dublin, California and Dublin, Ireland.
